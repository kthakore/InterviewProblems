Disqus coding challenge.

I used perl 5.14 to implement the code (I chose this language due to the power regular expressions features). I also used a RedBlack tree library from CPAN (which I have included in the lib/Tree/ folder). I chose this structure so that I wouldn't have to rescan the document and also due to the following wikipedia article:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree#Performance_comparisons

My approach was to generate suggestions based on the input and the search for the variations on the word. 

To solve the problem of uppercase error. I just lowercase'd the input and all the words in the dictionary before storing in the redblack tree.

The classes of error suggestions were implemented using the powerful regular expressions in perl. More detailed comments are included in the files below. 

1. Vowel replacement: lib/Correct/Vowel.pm
2. Duplicates: lib/Correct/Duplicate.pm

To run the prompt please do:

$ perl correct.pl

Incorrect word generation 

I used a dispatch to randomly select between the three errors.

To run the incorrect.pl 

$ perl incorrect.pl

$ perl incorrect.pl | perl correct.pl
